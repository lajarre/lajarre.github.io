      <description>Alan Kay Alan Kay&amp;rsquo;s keynote at start of CodeX FutureLaw conference on 2021-04-08.
   Kay says we need to draw on atavistic tendencies, especially the need for stories to be made and shared (campfire image).
I believe he is saying that trying to restrain (making humans fully rational agents) them is pointless.
He believes explanation and learning assisted by computers is essential.
Indeed, coronavirus pandemia and ongoing CO2 crises are wrongly understood, humans have failed to learn on things that matter.</description>

      <description>Compte-rendu par chapitre I. Newtonian and Bergsonian Time p32. Newtonian time is defined as the time variable of the physical laws, defined as a &amp;ldquo;formal set of postulates and a closed mechanics&amp;rdquo;.
ðŸ’¡ The transformation of the variable into its negative has no effect on the mechanics. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to notice that this holds formally pretty obviously (after all, any purely formal theory will have the characteristics decided by its &amp;ldquo;designer&amp;rdquo;).</description>
