      <description>Some reflections on the role of theoretical attacks within the cryptoeconomic-scientific method and how this relates to real-world institutions such as the state-of-the-art and an ecocystem.&#xA;The cryptoeconomic method History First, there was pulling a Satoshi, producing together a protocol and its implementation.&#xA;Then, there was theoretical attacks in the wild (starting with selfish mining), contradicting the current doxa on cryptoeconomic guarantees brought by the system.&#xA;Soon after, there was a call to action to bring together researchers around making game theoretical sense of Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>This is a quick summary of my main takeaways from the Free Will lectures given by John Conway at Princeton somewhere in 2009.&#xA;Videos can be found on Youtube (each has a duration of 1 hour):&#xA;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmx2tpcdKZY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPa4nVL09D4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-Ra8sc6-0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf_BGNZG-Xw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TVZDY2aN6s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgvkhgE1Cps This is all about the Free Will theorem by Conway and Kochen.&#xA;This series of lectures give a very approachable walkthrough of the proof for the theorem, as well as a pretty concrete confrontation to the philosophical consequences of such a theorem.</description>

      <description>Compte-rendu par chapitre I. Newtonian and Bergsonian Time p32. Newtonian time is defined as the time variable of the physical laws, defined as a &amp;ldquo;formal set of postulates and a closed mechanics&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;ðŸ’¡ The transformation of the variable into its negative has no effect on the mechanics. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to notice that this holds formally pretty obviously (after all, any purely formal theory will have the characteristics decided by its &amp;ldquo;designer&amp;rdquo;).</description>
